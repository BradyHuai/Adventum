Every round, a set of tiles will appear green before turning blue. Your job is to memorize the locations of the green tiles and tap the green tiles while avoiding the original blue tiles.
If you pick an incorrect tile, it will turn red. If you pick a correct tile, it will turn green.
To continue to the next round, click all the correct tiles while avoiding the incorrect ones. If you miss 2 tiles on one round you lose a life. Losing three lives will end the game! Tap as many green tiles and continue as long as possible.
Here you will be given a series of pictures among which a variety of woodland creatures are hiding. It is your job to deem correctly what creature lies within  the lines. You will have five guesses to correctly determine the given animal. Each consecutive level has increasingly difficult images for you to guess. Good luck!
When the screen turns green, tap as quickly as possible...
